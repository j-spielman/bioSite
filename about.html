            <p class="biography">            
                &emsp;Larisa Reams is a caring, outgoing individual who loves to interact with and support her community through the local performing arts at the Lincoln Community Playhouse. 
                Through various volunteer and production work, she brings the excitement of stage shows to a new generation by working with children and helping to teach them the theatre arts to perform.
                <br /><br />
                &emsp;Originally from Hastings, Nebraska, Larisa moved to Lincoln to attend the University of Nebraska – Lincoln and earned her bachelor’s degree in psychology from the College of Arts and Sciences. 
                She has since enrolled at Doane University to continue her education and is currently working towards her Master of Arts in Counseling to become a school counselor. 
                <br /><br />
                &emsp;She utilizes these skills by volunteering her time in the Lincoln chapter of the Penguin Project at the Lincoln Community Playhouse which helps young artists with developmental, 
                intellectual, and learning disabilities participate in life’s experiences. She has also worked on several productions at the Lincoln Community
                Playhouse in various roles ranging from backstage crew to stage management. When not busy working or volunteering at the theatre, Larisa works at a local mental health facility that offers several different 
                services to the community.
                <br /><br />
                &emsp;In her free time, Larisa enjoys the drama of fiction and theatre through other mediums such as comic books, with her favorites being Locke and Key and The Sandman, continuing 
                voice lessons to pursue her love of singing, and spending time at home with her fluffy senior cat Gus which she adopted from the local humane society.
