                    <p>The playhouse has been active in Lincoln since 1946 and offers many different projects for the community to take part in including several shows each season, 
                        theatre arts academy camps during the summer, senior shows, and the Penguin Project mentioned below.</p>

                    <h2 class="topic-title">Penguin Project</h2><br />
                    <p>From their website, the Penguin Project is focused on helping children with special needs “By providing access to community theater, The Penguin Project 
                        demonstrates that the special challenges of a disability should not handicap a child’s ability to participate in life’s experiences.” Larisa became involved in the project 
                        the first year the Lincoln Community Playhouse took part and has seen it grow exponentially each season.</p>
